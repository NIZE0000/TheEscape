Base on Legecy Opengl or Classic Opengl

Warning!!! 
* It not the worthest way to learn opengl with immediately function. if you want best practice I suggest you to use mordern opengl function for that because it flexible than classic function. to make you figure out in this present age all we used base on mordern opengl. But if you want to understand how people in 1992 made the graphics. Maybe it's good way to learn classic opengl.
