# TheEscape
3D game. 

Written with C++<br>
dependency use glfw and stb

Base on Legecy Opengl or Classic Opengl

Warning!!! 
* It not the worthest way to learn opengl with immediately function. if you want best practice I suggest you to use mordern opengl function for that because it flexible than classic function. to make you figure out in this present age we almost use mordern opengl but if you want to understand how people in 1992 made the graphics maybe it's good way use classic opengl.

Build with C Make
* Already check it can run on Linux and Windows.
* if you want to run on MacOS maybe you have to change CMakeList.txt before build this project.
