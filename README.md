# TheEscape
3D game. 

Written with C++<br>
dependencies use glfw and stb

Base on Legecy Opengl or Classic Opengl

Warning!!! 
* It not the worth way to learn opengl with immediately function. if you want best practice I suggest you to use mordern opengl function for that, because it flexible than classic function.

Build with C Make
* already check can build on Linux and Windows.
* if you want to build on MacOS. you have to update CMakeList.txt before build this project.

How to build it?

```sh
git clone --depth 1  https://github.com/NIZE2001/TheEscape.git
```
clone submodules 
```sh
git submodule init
```
```sh

<br>

or just use one command 
```sh
git clone --depth 1 --recurse-submodules --shallow-submodules  https://github.com/NIZE2001/TheEscape.git
